# Humin-Labs
Business foundations:

**Mission:**
*Reduce the barriers to acquiring and applying STEM skills in daily life*

**The Vision and Context of Humin Labs.**
- long-term vision
- guiding principles
- specific societal or national need(s) addressed
- Anticipated broader impacts

**Products:**

**Ecosystem**
Details on the current status of the open-source product development and testing model, methods of dissemination, user base, and contributor base; 
problem being addressed, and the novelty of the intended product being transitioned, including substantiating evidence of the technology's potential to significantly impact/address the problem in light of other solutions that may already exist

**The Team**
a strong justification that makes the case that the team is qualified to conduct this work.

**Risk Analysis/Security Plan** 
addresses all project-relevant risks and security aspects, particularly those related to the open-source products, such as data and source code including data privacy and code quality.
Proposers are encouraged to consider the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), guidance for developers on securing software supply chains and the Open Source Security Foundation's best practices.

Risk Analysis/Security Plan: Discuss anticipated security, safety, and privacy risks if the OSE will collaboratively develop and/or release any artifacts. Project activities can include exploration of the mechanisms that may be needed to ensure (i) quality, (ii) secure modification, integration, and release of content (e.g., secure software development methodologies, policies for patching known security vulnerabilities, etc.), (iii) identity and access management, and (iv) chain of custody.


**Community Outreach Plan**
outlines activities to engage the intended intellectual content developer community that will further develop and maintain the technology and identify user communities and/or organizations that will serve as early adopters of the technology. 

**Governance**
Organizational and governance structures; continuous development, integration, and deployment of the open-source product(s); and community building for users and intellectual content developers. 
Phase I scoping activities are intended to help teams determine whether (a) their open-source product is viable and ready to be transitioned into an OSE; (b) there is a user base that is ready to serve as early adopters; and (c) there is a distributed intellectual content developer community that can help develop and maintain the core product going forward.

Organization and Governance: Describe specific activities and their rationale that will identify: (i) the appropriate organizational, coordination, and governance models including the licensing approach to be employed; (ii) the specific continuous development and integration processes and infrastructure most suitable for open, asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product; (iii) processes for ensuring quality, security, privacy, or ethical concerns of new content; and (iv) the best methods for sustaining the organizational structure, including metrics to assess and evaluate long-term success of the development methodology, support for users, and on-boarding mechanisms for new contributors.

**Needs Discovery:** 
methods to evaluate and justify the need for the innovation within the current technological landscape; 

explains why the chosen approach is the right approach to further develop the technology; 

outlines ways to identify potential users who will utilize this technology and new developers who will contribute to it.


Community Building: Describe the specific activities to engage potential users and intellectual content developers, including: (i) identification of the specific research and development capabilities required of the potential contributor communities and (ii) mechanisms to engage these communities (e.g., workshops, hackathons, competitions, research coordination networks, and Ideas Labs).
Phase II: OSE Establishment and Expansion Awards

The objective of Phase II awards is to support the establishment of a sustainable and robust OSE.

Each Phase II proposal must describe the current context and the long-term vision and impact of the proposed OSE. The proposal should also include a well-developed, cohesive plan for building an OSE, including ecosystem establishment/growth; organizational and governance structure; a framework for continuous development, integration, and deployment of the technology; methods for evaluating the OSE's effectiveness; and activities to ensure security and privacy, build the community, and sustain the ecosystem.

Phase II proposals should include the following components in the Project Description:

Ecosystem Establishment/Growth: Include a well-developed ecosystem establishment and ongoing discovery strategy to ensure that the proposed OSE can effectively grow the open-source product within the current technological landscape, along with specific plans to identify, engage, and support potential users, contributors/developers, and partners. The engagement of industrial and international collaborators is also encouraged.
Organization and Governance: Describe a well-developed and sustainable organizational, coordination, and governance model including the licensing approach to be employed. The model should describe how key decisions will be made on product updating and development roadmaps.
Continuous Development Model: Describe the specific continuous development, integration, and deployment methodology and infrastructure that will be employed to enable the open, asynchronous, and distributed development of the open-source product and specific processes for ensuring quality control, security, and privacy of new content.
Risk Analysis/Security Plan: Enumerate important security, safety, and privacy risks in the proposed OSE continuous development model and describe a security plan that addresses these risks. The plan should discuss the following in the context of the specific risks: the identity and access management mechanisms that are planned for both users and content developers, as well as other mechanisms necessary to ensure (i) quality, (ii) secure modification, integration, and release of content (e.g., secure software development methodologies, policies for patching known security vulnerabilities), and (iii) chain of custody.
Community Building: Describe a long-term strategy for community building to engage, incentivize, on-board, and support potential users and contributors/developers who will help in further developing and maintaining the open-source product.
Sustainability: Articulate clear sustainability goals of the OSE both with respect to financial support mechanisms and strategies to sustain vibrant communities of users and intellectual content contributors.
Evaluation plan: Include a detailed and actionable evaluation plan, along with metrics to assess and evaluate success.
Budget and Budget Justification. Phase I and Phase II budgets should comply with the following guidelines. The maximum budget shown on the Cover Sheet and on the Budget must not exceed $300,000 for Phase I proposals and $1,500,000 for Phase II proposals. Proposals with budgets in excess of these limits will be returned without review.
